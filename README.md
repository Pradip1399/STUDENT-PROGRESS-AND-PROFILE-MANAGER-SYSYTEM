# STUDENT-PROGRESS-AND-PROFILE-MANAGER-SYSYTEM

It is simple web application where student can fill their personal details, accademics details, skills, internships, certifications, etc in each year of engineering. Based upon that faculty/mentor can see the progress of the student and also can retrieve their data according to there requirement.

This “student progress and profile manager system” is the project for college students and college faculties. The main objective of this project is to maintain students every year marks, other previous major educational information and also information about students extra-curriculum activities. This helps college faculties to keep track of every students progress. In this project, the faculties can also get all this information by using filters which can be applied while retrieving the data of
students.

The project is build on following technologies :
  Front end : HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrap4
  Back end : Php, MySQL

This project is done by me and my group members. We implemented this to learn and understand the flow of this system from front end to back end thoroughly.
